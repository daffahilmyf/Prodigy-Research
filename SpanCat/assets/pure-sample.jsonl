They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows."}

A Subject ID should also be collected for animals in an OM investigation. It may be a challenge to ensure unambiguous identification because demographic details of an animal are not easily identified; therefore, animals involved in investigations may need to be tagged."}
{"text": "The solution should provide detailed context-sensitive help material for all the possible actions and scenarios on all user interfaces in the application."}
{"text": "All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them. Ideally, each error message will be accompanied by explanatory text and an indication of the action(s) which the user can take in response to the error."}
