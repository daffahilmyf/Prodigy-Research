{"text": "The System must provide End User and Administrator functions which are easy to use and intuitive throughout."}
{"text": "Frequently-executed System transactions must be designed so that they can be completed with a small number of interactions (e.g. mouse clicks)."}
{"text": "The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive."}
{"text": "The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241."}
{"text": "ICT accessibility: ISO 9241-20 shall be the standard for guidance on ICT accessibility. Application user interfaces to meet its requirements and recommendations. Software accessibility ISO 9241-171 shall be the standard for guidance on software accessibility. User interfaces should meet its requirements and recommendations. Content accessibility WCAG 1.0 shall be the standard used for guidance on content accessibility. The application logo to be available on all pages as a link to the home page."}
{"text": "Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality."}
{"text": "Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next. General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110."}
{"text": "Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure."}
{"text": "Offering alternative access paths: Alternative access paths for navigating to a specific unit of content should be offered to support different navigation strategies."}
{"text": "Minimizing navigation effort: The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account."}
{"text": "Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered."}
{"text": "Avoiding opening unnecessary windows: Additional windows such as new browser windows or pop-up windows should only be opened if this supports the user\u2019s task. Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information. They could make it cognitively more difficult to understand the navigation structure with negative effects on both usability and accessibility. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows."}
{"text": "Vertical scrolling should be minimized. This may be done by placing important information at the top and providing links to information that is further down the page. Horizontal scrolling should be avoided wherever possible."}
{"text": "Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard."}
{"text": "Making user interfaces robust: User interfaces should be designed to be as robust as possible in the face of changing technology. This encompasses being able to present content containing newer technologies by older user agents as well as designing content to be usable with future technologies."}
{"text": "Acceptable opening / download times: Application pages should be designed and implemented so that there are acceptable opening times and download times for the expected range of technical contexts of use (e.g. bandwidth between the application and the user). This is particularly important for frequently accessed pages or pages that are important for user navigation and exploration, such as the home page."}
{"text": "Minimizing user errors: Potential user errors as well as the effort needed to recover from errors should be minimized."}
{"text": "Providing clear error messages: The content of error messages shown on the pages or special error pages should clearly state the reason why the error occurred and, if possible, actions the user can take to resolve the error. Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface."}
{"text": "Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency: When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable."}
{"text": "Making text resizable by the user: Text should be able to be resized by the user, using functions provided by the user agent or other appropriate means i.e. see ISO 9241-171."}
{"text": "Text quality: The quality of textual content with respect to spelling and grammar should be sufficient so as not to impede readability."}
{"text": "Writing style: The reading and understanding of the textual content on the screen should be supported by suitable means, including the use of short sentences, the division of the text into shorter chunks or the presentation of content items in the form of bullet points."}
{"text": "Supporting text skimming: Fast skimming of text should be supported by the provision of clear links, bulleted lists, highlighted keywords, logical headings, and short phrases and sentences."}
{"text": "Readability of text: Text presented on the pages should be readable taking into account the expected display characteristics and spatial arrangement. ISO 9241-303 shall be consulted for screen text legibility requirements."}
{"text": "Distinguishable within-page links: Within-page links should be clearly distinguishable from other links that lead to a different page. EX. Within-page links are shown with dashed rather than solid underlines"}
{"text": "Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text."}
{"text": "Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links \u2014 particularly links representing the main navigation structure \u2014 should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems."}
{"text": "Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as \u201cgo\u201d or \u201cclick here\u201d except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the user\u2019s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand."}
{"text": "Marking links opening new windows: Links that open new browser windows or pop-up windows should be clearly marked."}
{"text": "Distinguishing navigation links from controls: Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and presentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results."}
{"text": "Providing printable document versions: If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation)."}
{"text": "Use of \u201cwhite space\u201d: \u201cWhite space\u201d on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page. While white space is an important means of visually organizing the different content elements on a page, if the distance between the blocks of information displayed becomes too large, rapid skimming of the page can be impeded."}
{"text": "Selecting appropriate page lengths The length of a page should be selected so as to support the primary purpose and use of the page. Short pages are generally more appropriate for homepages, navigation pages, or overview pages that need to be read quickly. Longer pages can be more appropriate when users want to read the content without interruptions or when the page needs to match a paper counterpart."}
{"text": "Using colour: Colour should be used with care, taking into account human capabilities and restrictions in perceiving colour, and not as the only means of conveying information. Color should never be the only means of coding. Some users may have difficulties in perceiving certain colors or color combinations (color-blindness)."}
{"text": "Using frames with care: If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other."}
{"text": "Providing alternatives to frame-based presentation: If frames are used, an alternative way of presenting relevant information without frames should be provided. Providing alternative text-only pages: When style sheets and/or frames are turned off it should be possible for the user to read and understand the page; alternatively, the user should be provided with an equivalent alternative text-only page."}
{"text": "Consistent page layout: Pages should be designed using consistent layout schemes, supporting the user in finding similar information at the same position on different pages. Overall layout schemes apply to all pages and are preferable when all pages have a similar structure. Frequently, however, different pages have different purposes and types of content. In such cases, pages can usually be grouped in different categories, using one layout scheme for each category consistently."}
{"text": "Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages."}
{"text": "Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility."}
{"text": "Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user."}
{"text": "Providing a site map: A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form."}
{"text": "Consistency between navigation components and content: If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area."}
{"text": "Placing navigation components consistently: Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application."}
{"text": "Individualization and user adaptation : Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the user\u2019s behaviour and adapting to the user\u2019s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group."}
{"text": "Taking account of the users\u2019 tasks and information needs: When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration."}
{"text": "Making individualization and adaptation evident: It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used."}
{"text": "Making user profiles evident: If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications."}
